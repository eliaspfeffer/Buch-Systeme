# Buch-Systeme
Preview version of my book Systeme. This took me 4 years to make. Topics I cover are: How to build an AGI, reverse-engineering the Bitcoin price, figuring out the right questions to ask.

I originally planed to improve some more things and then sell this book, but after figuring out my theories on what the missing part for artifical general intelligence is (artificial consciousness) I thought I should not wait any longer to publish it - even tho it's still a non-finito. I could die in a car accident tomorrow or get diagnosed with cancer - who know how long I'm going to life - but the theories I've made in this book are, in my eyes, so important and will have (if my theories are even correct) such a massive impact on the prosperity of humanity, that I think now is the perfect time to publish this. 

This book is not for sale and you are not allowed to publish it on any other website - sharing a link to this repo is ok. You are also not allowed to sell it or redistribute it or make any profit directly or indirectly out of it without my written allowance. You are allowed to share the link to this GitHub Repo instead, so others in future have the chance to read the updated part. If you still want to read it as a physical book, I politely ask you to wait a bit longer and I will update you via this GitHub repo as soon, as the physical book comes out.
